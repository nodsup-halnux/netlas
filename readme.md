## %netlas - A Geospatial Network Visualizer:
~nodsup-halnux
Sept 2024


### Introduction:

Using a series of Ames scries, and Iris to extract online API data for IP addresses, I attempt to build a worldmap of all the %known peers for a particular urbit ship that runs this app.

I choose to ignore moons and comets for my graph, as the former lacks proper agency, and the latter has no SITG.  The graph represents planets, stars and galaxies only.

Somewhat ironically, to develop this project, I have to use a moon (divdev-divdev-nodsup-halnux).  A fakezod has a trivial/non-useful `ames-state` to scry, and talks to no ship on the urbit network.  

I start from a minimal desk, and build up, to make my app tiny[X]
