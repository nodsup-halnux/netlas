### Introduction:

Using a series of Ames scries, and Iris to extract online API data for IP addresses, I attempt to build a worldmap of all the %known peers for a particular urbit ship that runs this app.

I choose to ignore moons and comets for my graph, as the former lacks proper agency, and the latter has no SITG.  The graph represents planets, stars and galaxies only.
